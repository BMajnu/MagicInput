# MagicInput

A minimalistic popup GUI for entering text/code and attaching images, designed for quick input and interaction with AI models.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MagicInput.git
    cd MagicInput
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ./venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the application:

```bash
python MagicInput.py
```

## Visionize modes (Image Analysis)

MagicInput integrates Google Gemini for multimodal image+text analysis.

- **Plan:** Generate a step-by-step plan based on the image(s) and optional prompt.
- **Describe:** Produce a concise, professional description of the image(s).
- **Combine:** Merge planning and description for a hybrid output.

Outputs are inserted into the prompt as:

```
## Analysis
<generated content>

---
*Analysis Generated by AI*
```

Use the buttons: `Visionize` (generate into prompt) or `Visionize & Send` (generate then send).

## Context & Prompt Logging

- **Include context** checkbox shows additional toggles:
  - Project brief
  - Prompts archive
  - Terminal
- The latest prompt is written to `MagicInput/MagicInput Prompt.txt`.
- Older prompts are appended to `MagicInput/Prompts Archive.txt` with timestamps and separators.
- A status line shows “Waiting for prompt: Xs” with a count-up timer.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y: Undo/Redo
- Ctrl+X / Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V: Cut/Copy/Paste (Ctrl+V pastes clipboard image if available)

## Drag & Drop and Clipboard

## Settings, Models, and API Keys

- Select a Gemini model (default `gemini-2.5-flash`).
- Manage multiple API keys, set active order, and rotate automatically on rate limits.
- Option: Auto refine prompt before send.
- Config is persisted to `MagicInput/config.json`.

## Configuration

    - Open Settings (⚙) and add one or more keys.

*   **Config File:** Preferences are saved to `MagicInput/config.json`.

## Files & Storage

- App data folder: `MagicInput/` (created beside `MagicInput.py`).
- Logs: `MagicInput/debug.log` and `MagicInput/magicinput.log`.
- Prompts: `MagicInput/MagicInput Prompt.txt` (latest), `MagicInput/Prompts Archive.txt` (history).
- Attachments: files added are copied into the app data folder and referenced in the prompt.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Missing Dependencies:** If you encounter `ImportError` messages, ensure you have installed all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **UI Freezes/Lag:** If the application becomes unresponsive, it might be due to heavy operations. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements and consider restarting the application.
