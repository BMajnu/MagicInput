## Interactive Task Loop with User Feedback

1. **Check if `MagicInput.py` exists** in the root directory (don't rewrite or change on it, just run as it is to get user input/prompt.).

   * If it doesn't exist, create it with the following content:

     ```python
     # MagicInput.py
     prompt = input("prompt: ")
     ```

2. **Main Workflow**:

   * Perform your assigned tasks.

   * Run:

     ```bash
     python MagicInput.py
      ```
   * The terminal should be opened in the chat window itself.

   * After terminate the command, Checked command status and read the user's (MagicInput) input/prompt. 
   
   * If you can't read or got error to read the terminal user input/prompt then check the last prompt in MagicInput\MagicInput Prompt.txt

   * Based on the input/prompt, perform the next set of tasks.

   * Repeat the process.
