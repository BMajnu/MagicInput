## Terminal Jam issue/Cancel issue

1. If the terminal call is cancelled/or end without any result then will will run the terminal proccess killing command to kill it untill geting a command result, 
2. And after geting a command result, you will run the command again.


## Interactive Task Loop with User Feedback

1. **Check if `MagicInput.py` exists** in the root directory (don't rewrite or change on it, just run as it is to get user input/prompt.).

   * If it doesn't exist, create it with the following content:

     ```python
     # MagicInput.py
     prompt = input("prompt: ")
     ```

2. **Main Workflow**:

   * Perform your assigned tasks.

   * Run:

     ```bash
     python MagicInput.py
     ```
   * The terminal should be opened in the chat window itself.

   * after running the command, go to sleep for 100 seconds or run a conditional terminal command until it terminate, you will keep in sleep (sleep terminal call), and and read the previous command result. 

   * After terminate the command, read the user's (MagicInput) input/prompt. 
   
   * If you can't read or got error to read the terminal user input/prompt then check the last prompt in MagicInput\MagicInput Prompt.txt

   * Based on the input/prompt, perform the next set of tasks.

   * Repeat the process.

3. **Exit Condition**:

   * If the user enters `"stop"` when prompted, exit the loop and terminate the process.
